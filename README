A Linux kernel module providing bluescreen on kernel-panics! :o)

Not useful at all, it was created some years ago when I decided to make some
first steps in kernel development.
Due to it's age, I assume it doesn't even build against modern kernel-versions
at all, but I decided to dump it here anyway.
